### Climbing App Backend - Practice Project  

This repository serves as a **practice project** to explore and gain hands-on experience with **Docker**, **Flask**, and **SQLAlchemy**. The setup includes a Docker Compose configuration for running a backend application with Flask and PostgreSQL. While created as a learning exercise, this backend could be adapted to serve as the foundation for a **Climbing App**.  

#### Features  

- RESTful API endpoints to manage boulder problems.  
- A PostgreSQL database initialized with tables for climbing data.  
- Dockerized environment for seamless setup and scalability.  

#### Setup  

1. **Clone the repository.**  
2. **Customize database credentials:**  
   Update the PostgreSQL username and password in the configuration files as needed.  
3. **Build and start the containers:**  
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
